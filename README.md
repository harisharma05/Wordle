# Wordle Clone

A simple text-based Wordle game built in Java.  
The player has 6 attempts to guess a random 5-letter word. After each guess, letter-by-letter feedback is provided:

- ⚠️ `(letter)`: correct letter in the wrong position (yellow)
- ❌ ` letter `: letter not in the word (grey)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a 5-letter word as your guess.
3. Use the feedback to improve your next guess.
4. You have 6 total attempts.
5. After each game, you’ll be asked if you want to play again.
